Technology used: **React, Tailwind CSS , React TipTap, React Router** and so on

Challenges I faced to create this extention:
**Custom Styling:**
Applying custom styles to the .ProseMirror wrapper was difficult due to TipTap’s default styles overriding custom CSS.
**Input Fields and Placeholders:**
Ensuring input fields and placeholders worked properly inside the editor required adjusting TipTap’s behavior for interactive elements.
**Button Active States:**
Styling buttons to change their background color on activation was tricky, requiring state management and CSS fine-tuning.
**Consistent Appearance:**
Maintaining consistent styling across the editor’s UI components while integrating multiple extensions proved challenging.
**Handling Extensions:**
Configuring extensions like Color and TextStyle to work together without conflicts required careful setup.
**Custom Nodes and Extensions:**
Understanding TipTap’s custom nodes and extensions for complex styling and content modifications was a learning curve.
